SDLC Process
BlogView was developed using a structured Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Planning: Defined goals for bloggers, readers, and developers; set a 3-week timeline.
Requirement Analysis: Outlined functional (authentication, blogging, commenting) and non-functional (security, performance) requirements.
Design: Created wireframes, a minimalistic UI, and a Flask + MySQL architecture.
Implementation: Built frontend (HTML/CSS/JS), backend (Flask), and database (MySQL) with modular, secure code.
Testing: Performed unit, integration, cross-browser, mobile responsiveness, and user testing; tracked issues via GitHub Issues.
Deployment: Hosted on Heroku or Vercel with secure environment variables and live testing.
Maintenance: Monitors performance, collects feedback, and plans features like notifications or dark mode.

Testing

Unit Testing: Validated components like authentication and post creation.
Integration Testing: Ensured seamless database, authentication, and post interactions.
Cross-Browser Testing: Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
Mobile Responsiveness: Optimized for various devices.
User Testing: Gathered feedback to improve usability and design.

Deployment

Hosted on Heroku or Vercel for scalability and reliability.
Configured environment variables for secure database access.
Verified live features (authentication, post creation, commenting).
Shared URL (e.g., yourblogview.herokuapp.com) for feedback.
